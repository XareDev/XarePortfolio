                    <h2>Iâ€™m a Frontend developer.</h2>
                    <p>Hey there! My name is Youcef, and I'm a 17-year-old Algerian Frontend developer residing in Hassi Messoued. My journey into the world of development began in 2019 when I discovered my interest in Python. However, in 2021, I shifted my focus towards web development, and it has become my true passion.
                    Over time, I have gained valuable experience in building impressive web applications, leveraging both my passion for development and my previously mentioned hobbies. As a freelancer, I have been able to create visually appealing and well-designed web applications. Some of my notable projects include an educational website, an anime streaming site, a local business site, and much more.
                    <br> Here are a few of the technologies I have been working with recently:</p>
